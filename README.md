# InventoryManager Demo

This is a simple practice project demonstrating a clean separation between backend and frontend using:

- **ASP.NET Core Web API** (Backend) => Layered Architecture with separation of concerns, following SOLID Principles.
- **Blazor WebAssembly** (Frontend) => Only shows a simple list of Items that can be added using Swagger UI.

  The focus hast been on the backend side + itegration with Blazor Webassemly on the frontend.
  The frontend needs to be completed!
